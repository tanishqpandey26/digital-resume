    title: '6. Music & your brain',
    
    content: `The sixth blog in this series, 'How to Use Music to Boost Motivation, Mood & Improve Learning' covers the following:<br/>
1. Listening to music promotes heart rate variability, triggered by changes in breathing patterns. <br/>
2. Music is an auditory and emotional experience that programs a specific set of motor actions likely to occur. <br/>
3. Listening to music faster than 140–150 beats per minute creates a heightened sense of motivation in the body to move. <br/>
4. Listening to music 10–15 minutes before exercise or cognitive work helps improve engagement in the activity. <br/>
5. Binaural beats at a frequency of 40 Hz can enhance focus and concentration, while other frequencies may have a detrimental effect.<br/>
6. For cognitive tasks, the effectiveness scenarios are as follows: complete silence > instrumental music only > music with lyrics > listening to favorite music. Additionally, 40 Hz binaural beats or brown/white noise > working in silence.<br/>
7. Internal dialogue or listening to yourself while reading helps with information retention.<br/>
8. Listening to music with lyrics during breaks in cognitive work can improve retention.<br/>
9. Fast-paced music, such as rock and roll, during breaks between bouts of exercise may enhance physical performance.<br/>
10. The threshold for shifting to a happier mood by listening to happy music (frequency of words > 140 Hz) is 9 minutes.<br/>
11. Listening to sad music (frequency < 60 Hz) for 13 minutes or more can help process and move past sad emotions.<br/>
12. Listening to "Weightless" by Marconi Union can reduce anxiety by up to 65%.<br/>
13. Listening to novel forms of music for 30–60 minutes a day, three times a week, can expand brain connectivity.`,

    content: `I appeared for my CAT exam on 24th November. I had been preparing for it for the past six months. To be honest, I could have done better. I got a bit stressed, which resulted in me missing out on some doable questions. According to the analysis, the paper was easier compared to previous years. Now, just waiting for the results!`,

    title: '5.Salt for brain & body',
    content: `The fifth blog in this series, 'Using Salt to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance' covers the following:<br/>
  1. There are two types of thirst: osmotic and hypovolemic, both of which drive the body to seek water and salt. <br/>
  2. Vasopressin acts as an anti-diuretic hormone.<br/>
  3. According to dietary recommendations, 2.3–4 grams of salt per day (about half a teaspoon) is advised. Keeping track of blood pressure is important, especially if hypertension is present.<br/>
  4. Galpin Equation: Body weight in pounds divided by 30 equals the ounces of fluid recommended to drink every 15 minutes.<br/>
  5. Carbohydrates help retain fluids in the body. If on a low-carb diet, increase salt intake, and vice versa.<br/>
  6. Caffeine is a diuretic, so increasing salt and fluid intake may be helpful.`,

    title: '4.Hair loss and Hair Regrowth',
    content: `The fourth blog in this series, 'The Science of Healthy Hair, Hair Loss and How to Regrow Hair' covers the following:<br/>

  1. Hair growth consists of three phases: Anagen phase(hair grows), catagen phase(hair recedes and dies) and telogen phase (low active or quiet phase of stem cells) <br/>
2. Dihydrotestosterone promotes catagen phase<br/>
3. Minoxidil, vasodilator promotes hair growth but has side effects, oral dosage - 0.25 to 5mg per day, topical form - 5% concentration, 1-2 times applied for 5 mins, hair regrowth resulting from minoxidil stays as long as you keep on using it, so it becomes a lifelong procedure; Tadalafil 2.5 to 5mg <br/>
4. Microneedling with needles 1 to 2.5 mm, combining microneedling with minoxidil is quite effective<br/>
5. IGF1 and cyclic AMP are accelerators of hair growth, DHT inhibit them<br/>
6. Caffeine in ointments as topical treatments, three times a week, botox procedures also help hair growth<br/>
7. Iron levels in blood for men 30 to 150, women 25 to 100 , saw palmetto berries extract 300 mg a day in 2-3 doses<br/>
8. Ketoconazole shampoo alteast 2% concentration , 2-4 times a week, with scalp contact of 3-5mins.<br/>
9. Finasteride, in topical forms 1% concentration, can have severe side effects, oral form in range between 0.5 to 1mg <br/>
10. Dutasterde in oral form in 0.5 to 2.5mg, more potent than finasteride but with more severe side effects`,

    title: '3.Microplastics & your health',
    content: `
    The third blog in this series, 'The Effects of Microplastics on Your Health & How to Reduce Them' covers the following: <br/>

1. Try to avoid using plastic water bottles as much as possible; if you have the budget, you can use RO filters to treat tap water. <br/>
2. Sea salt contains microplastics; use Himalayan pink salt if possible, depending on your budget. <br/>
3. Avoid canned soups; as a joke, eat them only when it is a matter of life and death. <br/>
4. Dont microwave plastic containers; "microwave-safe" on a container means the container will not melt, but it does not guarantee that you wont be exposed to microplastics. <br/>
5. Avoid consuming hot liquids in paper cups. <br/>
6. Elevated levels of phthalate metabolites are associated with lower testosterone. <br/>
7. The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying microplastics from the body. This detoxification can be enhanced by consuming sulforaphane, present in cruciferous veggies such as broccoli and cauliflower. It is best if eaten raw or lightly cooked but not boiled. Andrew takes a supplement of 50 mg sulforaphane. <br/>
8. Eating fiber can also help excrete microplastics. <br/>
9. Avoid non-stick pans; use cast iron or ceramic pans. <br/>
10. Sweating can assist in removing microplastics. <br/>
11. Avoid packaged foods as much as possible; avoid washing clothes frequently, as it releases a lot of microplastic from the fibers. <br/>
12. Avoid microwave popcorn; use tooth tablets instead of toothpaste. <br/>

    title: "2.Second blog on podcast summary",
    content: `The second blog in this series, 'Using Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System' covers the following: <br/>  1. Practice nasal breathing and avoid touching your eyes. Consume 2-4 servings of fermented foods daily. <br/> 2. Elevate your heels by 12 degrees to support a better immune response. Try NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) with your feet elevated. <br/> 3. A 15-minute sauna session can enhance the immune system by increasing white blood cells. Aim for humidity levels of ±15%, with a cool-off period of 5 to 10 minutes before returning to the sauna. <br/> 4. Eating foods rich in serotonin can help combat infections. <br/> 5. Perform a breathing exercise: 25-30 inhales and exhales, followed by an exhale and hold period. Complete 3 sets of this exercise. <br/> 6. Maintaining a healthy mindset can aid in preventing and fighting sickness. Higher dopamine levels may also be beneficial. <br/> 7. Spirulina (2g) can help alleviate rhinitis. <br/> 8. Acupuncture may also be helpful but is highly individualized. `,

    title: "1.First blog on podcast summary",
    content: "The first blog in this series on : 'Optimal Protocols for Studying & Learning' <br/>  1. Periodic testing is crucial. <br/> 2. The strain you feel trying to learn is good. <br/> 3. Perception exercise is good, teaching what you have learned to others helps you remember things better, make schedules for learning. <br/> 4. Reading and thinking about what you have read is better than re-reading same material multiple times. <br/> 5. Testing is the greatest learning tool, frequency of testing increases learning efficiency. <br/> 6. The best time to self test is just after being exposed to the new material, followed by a test after a period. <br/> 7. Self test should be open ended and not mcqs. <br/> 8.  Any kind of story with emotional emphasis is more likely to be readily commited to memory, reason - neuromodulators. <br/> 9. Cold exposure, caffeine, good sleep also do contribute to effective learning. <br/> 10. Interleaving information also does help. ",
