    The second blog in this series, 'Using Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System' covers the following: <br/>
      1. Practice nasal breathing and avoid touching your eyes. Consume 2-4 servings of fermented foods daily. <br/>
      2. Elevate your heels by 12 degrees to support a better immune response. Try NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) with your feet elevated. <br/> 
      3. A 15-minute sauna session can enhance the immune system by increasing white blood cells. Aim for humidity levels of Â±15%, with a cool-off period of 5 to 10 minutes before returning to the sauna. <br/> 
      4. Eating foods rich in serotonin can help combat infections. <br/>
       5. Perform a breathing exercise: 25-30 inhales and exhales, followed by an exhale and hold period. Complete 3 sets of this exercise. <br/> 
       6. Maintaining a healthy mindset can aid in preventing and fighting sickness. Higher dopamine levels may also be beneficial. <br/>
        7. Spirulina (2g) can help alleviate rhinitis. <br/>
         8. Acupuncture may also be helpful but is highly individualized.
