    title: '5.Salt for brain & body',
    content: `
    The fifth blog in this series, 'Using Salt to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance' covers the following: <br/>

1. There are two types of thirst: osmotic and hypovolemic, both of which drive the body to seek water and salt.<br/>
2. Vasopressin acts as an anti-diuretic hormone.<br/>
3. According to dietary recommendations, 2.3â€“4 grams of salt per day (about half a teaspoon) is advised. Keeping track of blood pressure is important, especially if hypertension is present.<br/>
4. Galpin Equation: Body weight in pounds divided by 30 equals the ounces of fluid recommended to drink every 15 minutes.<br/>
5. Carbohydrates help retain fluids in the body. If on a low-carb diet, increase salt intake, and vice versa.<br/>
6. Caffeine is a diuretic, so increasing salt and fluid intake may be helpful.<br/>
